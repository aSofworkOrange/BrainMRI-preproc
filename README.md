# BrainMRI-preproc
Comprehensive and consistent brain MRI images pre-processing pipeline for Deep Learning applications enablingthe creation of a congruous data-sets.

This comprehensive  pre-processing  pipeline  able  to  prepare  raw MRI brain images data-sets (with the correspondinglesions masks, if present) so that they can be directlyfed  into  Deep  Learning  architectures.  The  pipelinehas been implemented entirely in Python and particular attention has been paid in giving the possibility to directly access each functionsâ€™ parameters to allow further customizations/optimizations. 

The workflow is based on [ANTsPy](https://antspy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
